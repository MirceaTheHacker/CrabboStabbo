# CrabboStabbo
2D Platformer Adventure Game made in Unity

STORY:
It is the year 2023, humanity kept on fishing and consuming crabs until all species became extinct, or so everyone thought. The main character is Mr. Crabbo Stabbo, the last crab on earth. Help him make justice and defeat the chefs trying to cook him up.

Game mechanics:  
•	You can throw knives around and kill the enemies.  
•	The knives remain stuck to walls so that you can use them in order to climb your way up on them.  
•	There is a type of enemy that splits into two smaller versions of itself upon death.  
•	Plenty of particle systems enhancing the experience graphically.  
•	Adjusted the gravity acceleration with a script such that the jump has a better feel to it.

Animations and Tiles:  
•	Made in Adobe Photoshop by myself.  
•	Style: Pixel Art.  
•	Used Anima2D to animate one of the enemies.
